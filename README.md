Version 15. September 2020



#### Introduction:

CRIRES-planning-tool is a software tool developed over the course of my Master's project under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Nikolai Piskunov and Dr. Andreas Korn, in collaboration with Dr. Alexis Lavail

The CRIRES-planning-tool is intended to be used to plan transit observations of exoplanets for CRIRES+, the new cross-dispersed high-resolution infrared spectrograph for the ESO VLT [CRIRES+](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/crires_up.html). Observaton of exoplanets can be planned in two ways. Single candidate by name in a given timespan or by using constraints for observable candidates by CRIRES+, which can be loaded from the file: Nasa_Archive_Selection.txt (see section: **Constraints for Candidates**). The known exoplanets fulfilling these constraints are downloaded from NASA Exoplanet Archive and each candidate is checked for its observability from Cerro Paranal, Chile for during a given time frame. Each observable candidate is checked for a minimum signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)≥100 during 20 exposures. This constrain will likely be updated in the future to distinguish between observations of super-Earth's or giant planets, and sensitive to the host star spectral type. Each exposure is related to its total exposure time, calculated from the detector integration time multiplied with the number of detector integrations: (TEXP = DIT x NDIT) and NDIT is optimized to be within 16≤NDIT≤32 for each exposure (see section: **Exposure Time Calculator**). Candidates with observability of the complete transit are added to the observation list and further information can be found in the output excel files (see section: **Result files**). The tool uses two ways to calculate the number of exposures possible during a single transit. The details are described in my master thesis: *Planning observations of terrestrial Exoplanets around M type Stars with CRIRES+*, section *3.3 Signal-to-noise ratio and the Exposure Time Calculator*. The tool comes with plotting tools and a commandline window to access its functionalities. This document shall give an overview about the functionalities, accessibility, structure,  installation, and further development possibilities of the CRIRES-planning-tool. Code documentation can be found in **Code documentation** and a dependency tree is presented in **Dependencies**. The methods used for astronomical calculations are used from the astropy and astroplan library, about which documentation can be found here: [astroplan](https://astroplan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/).  



#### Installation:

1. Navigate to your chosen directory to install the CRIRES-planning-tool.

2. Download github repository: 
   `git clone https://github.com/jonaszubindu/CRIRES-planning-tool`

3. Setup a virtual environment to install the correct packages to run the planning tool

   `cd CRIRES-planning-tool/python`

   `pip install virtualenv`

   `virtualenv --python python3.7 [name of your venv]`

   activate your virtual environment:

   `source [name of your venv]/bin/activate`

   install the requirements to run CRIRES-planning-tool stored in requirements.txt

   `pip  install -r requirements.txt`

   after you are done with running CRIRES-planning-tool use 

   `deactivate`

   to deactivate the virtual environment. 

4. Create directories for data storage:

   `mkdir Plots`

5. To run CRIRES-planning-tool run go into the p

   `./Transit_List.py`

   If ./Transit_List.py has not the proper rights to be run, use

   `chmod +x Transit_List.py`

   

Everytime you use the CRIRES-planning-tool, you should update the repository with

`git pull`

and run the tool in your virtual environment, by activating it and installing the requirements with pip.

`source [name of your venv]/bin/activate`

`pip  install -r requirements.txt`



#### Commandline Menu

Running Transit_List.py presents the following commandline window with options:

<img src="docs/Screenshot%202020-09-15%20at%2017.37.05.png" alt="commandline menu" style="zoom:75%;" />

1. Runs a complete check of all available candidates fulfilling the constraints from Nasa_Archive_Selection.txt for a certain timescale. The tool asks for the starting date and the number of days to run the candidate list for and asks if the ETC part should also be run. Final results can only be optained by running the ETC part as well.
2. Runs the ETC part, where each observation of each observable candidate is checked for the possibiliy of 20 exposures with each one of them reaching S/N≥100 from a stored picklefile. This can be used for instance if something during the ETC part running option 1 goes wrong, and one wants to continue from where the problem occured during the first run.
3. Checks the observability of a single candidate by name for a certain timeframe.
4. Other targets can be run in the same way as exoplanetary candidates. However, this feature is not included yet.
5. Make plots from stored datafile from \picklefiles, the options to make plots are also presented at the end of running 1, 2 or 3. 

<img src="docs/Screenshot%202020-09-15%20at%2018.34.05.png" alt="plot_menu" style="zoom:60%;" />

The following plots can be produced:

Schedule for entire period, if the estimated error is greater than 1 hour the transit is shown in orange and if the candidate is not reaching a minimum signal-to-noise ratio S/N≤100, the transit is shown in red. The error is estimated from the error in the measurement of the period of the exoplanet's orbit.

![single_night](docs/2020-06-10-single_night.png)

and target finder image by name:

<img src="docs/Figure_1.png" alt="target_find" style="zoom:80%;" />

The tool should guide one self-explanatory through each step. 

For the case, the user gets asked to enter the name of the appropriate picklefile, refer to section: **Result files**.

## IN CASE SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND THE TOOL DOES NOT KNOW WHY

![random error](docs/Screenshot%202020-09-17%20at%2016.22.51.png)



If you happen to see this message, save the present state of the data by entering **y** for yes. It might happen sometimes that the server at ESO or your computer has a hickup and the problem is actually easily solvable. To see if that's the case, rerun ./Transit_List.py, choose menu point 2, enter the date of the file under which the data was stored and the number of days the tool was running for. Compare the name the tool suggests to you where it should look for the data to where you just have saved the data. If they are the same, press enter and let the tool run. In most cases this should fix the problem.



#### Constraints for Candidates

The constraints can be found in Nasa_Archive_Selection.txt and can be adequately changed.
The constraints are loaded with the script Request_Table_NasaExoplanetArchive.py: (excerpt from code documentation.

"*Request Confirmed Exoplanets Table from Nasa Exoplanet Archive*

*This script opens a file with constraints and columns that should constrain the Nasa exoplanets archive data.*
*The script contains two important information:*

*which columns do you want to import in your Exoplanet table*

*and*

*with which contraints should the table be filtered.*

*The script looks automatically for constraints and columns in a file called Nasa_Archive_Selection.txt.
It is important that columns are defined as COLUMN and constraints as CONSTRAINT for the script to find them.
Please do not add any special characters to a column or constraint. Write the constraint in the format* 

constraint < value 

*explicitly with spaces similar to the other constraints. The logic symbol < and > are inclusive(>=, <=). 
Like this the module will find the details of the constraint. Make sure that the defined constraints are
also columns of the table you request. Otherwise the constraints are not applicable.
The script creates a URL to request for the exoplanet table and filters the initial table after the constraints.
It stores a .csv file of that table that can be imported to Transit_List.py via csv_file_import.py*"

Running the script will yield the following 

`Write name to store file: [PlanetList.csv] ` 

where one can choose a different name (without suffix .csv) to store the data and press enter, if one would like to use the data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive in a different manner. Pressing enter will choose the default name.

The script classes_methods/csv_file_import.py imports PlanetList.csv or any other file defined in classes_methods/csv_file_import.py. The existence of csv_file_import.py is at the moment rather ambiguous. However, in the future, by adding different sources for target information, this file could expand in its functionality.



#### Exposure Time Calculator

The exposure time calculator is called through a client and requires a json input file containing all the input data to compute the exposure time or the signal-to-noise ratio for a  particular observation. The exposure time calculator is provided by ESO and maintained by [Jakob Vinther](j.vinther@eso.org). The theory behind the ETC can be looked up in my thesis: *Planning observations of terrestrial Exoplanetsaround M type Stars with CRIRES+*, section *3.3 Signal-to-noise ratio and the Exposure Time Calculator*. The public interface can be accessed [here](https://etctestpub.eso.org/observing/etc/crires). Any updates of the etc conflicting with the CRIRES-planning tool should be checked in correspondence with Jakob Vinther. Here are a few reasons why CRIRES-planning-tool might not be able to access the ETC anymore and strategies to solve it:

1. The baseurl to call the ETC with the cli has changed. You can change the baseurl in the file: /python/classes_methods/etc_cli.py

2. The structure of the input json file has changed. There are several ways to fix this. The easiest way is by accessing the api version of the etc and plugging in standard inputs. Clicking on the box Show json input file: 

   ![etcapi](docs/Screenshot%202020-09-15%20at%2018.19.24.png)



one can download the jsonfile and depending on the desired input method as one of the following. Before you store you store the file, make sure that you make a copy of the old json file(s). 

​	calculating S/N, using spectral templates -> store file as: 

> etc-form-default-snr-Templ.json

​	calculating S/N, using effective temperature of the target -> store file as: 

> etc-form-default-snr-Teff.json

​	or calculating exposure time for minimum S/N, using spectral templates: -> store file as: 

> etc-form-default-ndit-Templ.json

​	or calculating exposure time for minimum S/N, using effective temperature of the target: -> store file as: 

>etc-form-default-ndit-Teff.json

Check for differences between the old and the new file. Check in the script Etc_form_class.py if the function update_etc_form is still following the right structure to write input data into the replaced json file and adjust the structure adequately. To test the structure of the input json file, navigate to CRIRES-planning-tool/python, open an iPython console and type the following:

```python
from classes_methods import Etc_form_class
etc_form = Etc_form_class.etc_form('[jsonfile-type]')
```

and write the desired type of json input file at [jsonfile-type]: snr-Templ, edit-Templ, snr-Teff, ndit-Teff. Now you can investigate the structure of etc_form by writing [etc_form] + [.] + [Tab] and navigate through the file... 

If none of these two strategies solve the problem, you need to contact Jakob Vinther.



#### Result files

Result files are available as follows: 

**picklefiles**

If anything goes wrong during the operation of CRIRES-planning-tool, the user gets asked if they would like to store the present state of the list Eclipses_List containing instances of the class Eclipses. The files get stored as

Eclipse_events_processed\_[start date]\_[number of days]d.pkl

in case of running a full transit planning and

[name of planet]_events\_processed\_[start date]\_[number of days]d.pkl

for planning of a single candidate.

OBS! This does not happen if the user interrupts a process by `Ctrl + c` . 

Loading a file from picklefiles loads the instances of the class Eclipses contained in the file and stores them again in Eclipses_List or as single instance Planet.



**csv_files** or **xlsx_files**

The fully processed files get stored as csv files and xlsx files. csv files and xlsx files get stored after the same name logic as the picklefiles. The **csv-files** contain two lists. The first list contains all the observable transits ranked after the following method:

![ranking](docs/ranking.png)

The ranking is done using the function data_sorting_and_storing from Helper_fun.py. Additionally the list contains all the data related to that transit.

The second list contains the exact observational data at the begin, mid and end of each transit and is ordered in time. A sample csv file is presented below:

![csv_file](docs/csvfile.png)



The **xlsx** files have the same lists as the csv files and one additional list in which nights are grouped together for highest number of observations. This is a suggestion how nights could be combined together to have the maximum number of observable targets with high S/N. The ranking of nights respectively targets will be subject to future work. The algorithm works in the following way:

1. sort list of observations for number\_of\_exposures\_possible
2. make groups with observations during the same night
3. merge groups of adjacent nights 
4. sum number\_of\_exposures\_possible for each night
5. Rank according to the summed up number\_of\_exposures\_possible per night

OBS! If there are overlapping observations, they are counted both into the ranking, since it is not clear which observation should be selected. 

For transmission spectroscopy nights with the same observable planets must be combined to reach a certain minimum signal level for the subsequent analysis.


#### Dependencies

The following figures depict the structure of CRIRES-planning-tool, how its classes, class methods, and functions are organised. Except Transit_List.py, all imported modules presented below are stored in the folder classes_methods. Here are some short explanations to each module:

misc.py - controls any interaction between the user and the tool. 

Transit_List.py - the main script, managing and running all classes and functions and other scripts. 

csv_file_import.py - solemnly created to import the filtered data from Request_Table_NasaExoplanetArchive.py (not depicted in this figure, since it does not interact with any of the modules related to Transit_List.py).

classes.py - contains all classes related to planet data

Helper_fun.py - contains all functions called by in Transit_List.py and the class methods in classes.py

Etc_form_class.py - contains a class and class methods to interact with the Exposure Time Calculator ETC by ESO and debug any falty interactions. 

What the different functions and methods do can be read up in **Code documentation** 

<img src="docs/Dependency_tree-1.png" alt="dependency_tree" style="zoom:100%;" />



For each planet an instance of the class Eclipses is created and worked with to store data about its observability and its achievable signal-to-noise ratio S/N.

The instances are stored either as **Planet** or **planet** and each observable eclipse in the list **eclipse_observable** is called and worked with as **eclipse**. 

![dep_tree2](docs/Dependency_tree-2.png)

The different modules are described in the code itself and the subsequent section **Code documentation**.



#### Code documantation

##### Transit_List.py

Original File Transit List. This file contains all the routines to use the functions, classes and class methods to compute observability of targets, transits of exoplanets and to call the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) from ESO to calculate S/N signal to noise ratio for observations with CRIRES+.

The different functionalities can be accessed via a menu popping up when running this file.

More functionalities can of course be added and the ETC part can be extended to other instruments used at the VLT in Paranal, Chile.

The part about observability using methods from astropy and astroplan could also be extracted and used for other observatories and under different constraints. For that purpose, change (line 117 - 135):

```python
""" Location and UTC offset Paranal """
paranal = Observer.at_site('paranal', timezone='Chile/Continental')

midnight = datetime.time(0, 0, 0)


""" Altitude constraints definition """
Altcons = astroplan.AltitudeConstraint(min=+30 * u.deg, max=None)

""" Airmass constraints definition """
Airmasscons = astroplan.AirmassConstraint(min=None, max=1.7)

""" Astronomical Nighttime constraints definition: begin and end of each night at paranal as AtNightConstraint.twilight_astronomical """
Night_cons_per_night = astroplan.AtNightConstraint.twilight_astronomical()

""" Moon Constraint """
Mooncons = astroplan.MoonSeparationConstraint(min=+45 * u.deg, max=None)

constraints = [Night_cons_per_night, Altcons, Airmasscons, Mooncons]

def connect(host='http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/'):  # Nasa Exoplanet Archive
    """Check Internet Connection to Nasa Exoplanet Archive"""
```

If you want to change the observer, you need to copy the new observer also to the files Helper_fun.py and classes.py in python/classes_methods.
